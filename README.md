# Hyper-Dense-5G-Deployment-Problem

Metaheuristic approach for the Hyper-Dense 5G Network Deployment Problem.

## 1. Definition
The HDDP (Hyper-Dense Deployment Problem) is a formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Given a set of users distributed over an area of interest, the aim is to find an optimized 5G network deployment design that minimizes cost and interferences, while maximizing the coverage ratio. 

## 2. Model
The HDDP is modeled as proposed in _Shih-Jui Liu and Chun-Wei Tsai. An effective search algorithm for hyper-dense deployment problem of 5G. Procedia Computer Science 141:151â€“158, 01/2018_. Please, refer to this paper for more details.
